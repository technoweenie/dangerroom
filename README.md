# Danger Room

The Danger Room is a training center for web services to hone their HTTP
request skills.  It includes alien Shi'ar proxy technology, creating the ultimate
SOA simulator.

TODO:

* Autoloading TOML configuration
* Configure HTTP paths with specific responses, or proxy them to external
services.
* Handlers can be configured with bad behavior, such as long initial response
times, slow body transfers, partial bodies, etc.
